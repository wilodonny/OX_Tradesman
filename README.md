# OX_Tradesman
A simple selling script for QBcore + Ox inventory (Not QB-INV but can be easily modified)

This script is a simple selling script for QB core frame work with OX_Inventory, you can set a custom blip, set any item you like for sale and the script will dynamically offer only options for whats in your inventory that matchs the config, pay out in cash or bank from the simple in game UI. 

1) Download and extract the zip file
2) Rename to ox_tradesman
3) Add to your resource folder
4) Add "ensure ox_tradesman* to your server.cfg 
5) Configure the config to your liking 

When adding items they must be in your OX_Inventory/data/items.lua and you must add both the item name and label. 
I have not tested this with QB-Inventory and as such cannot offer any support however simple coding should translate it easy enough.
